# Yolov4_with_robust_abnormal_bbox_deletion_algorithm

## Abstract
No matter how good the model is, it is inevitable that there will be abnormal candidate boxes, so I made a good algorithm to filter out those abnormal candidate boxes.

## Usage
This code is based on yolov4, so please download the code from here first: https://github.com/miemie2013/Pytorch-YOLOv4
